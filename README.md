### Project Dates
🎡 Start Date: November 4, 2024 <br>
🎡 Expected Completion Date: November 24, 2024 <br>

### Project Overview
Hamster Crossing is an interactive website that demonstrates two path-finding algorithms, A* and Dijkstra's, in a grid-based environment. Users guide a hamster (the subject) to reach a sunflower seed (the goal) while navigating barriers that can be randomly generated or user-defined. Key functionalities include starting/ending point selection, dynamic grid customization, and real-time visualization of algorithmic pathways. <br>
🐹 A Algorithm*: Uses heuristic estimations for expedited route finding. <br>
🐹 Dijkstra's Algorithm: Explores all possible paths consistently. <br>

### Resource Allocation
**Tools and Technologies** <br>
	🌻 Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 <br>
	🌻 Backend: JavaScript <br>
	🌻 APIs/Frameworks: TBD <br>
	🌻 Security Tools: TBD <br>
 **Required Resources** <br>
	🌻 GitHub, IDEs for development <br>
	🌻 Multimedia resources for integration <br>

### Success Criteria
*The project will be successful if:* <br>
🎡 The web app accurately visualizes Dijkstra and A* algorithms. <br>
🎡 It meets performance, usability, and security standards. <br>
🎡 All deliverables (source code, documentation, presentation) are completed on time.<br>
