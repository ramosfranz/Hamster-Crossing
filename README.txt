Project Overview
Hamster Crossing is an interactive website that demonstrates two path-finding algorithms, A* and Dijkstra's, in a grid-based environment. Users guide a hamster (the subject) to reach a sunflower seed (the goal) while navigating barriers that can be randomly generated or user-defined. Key functionalities include starting/ending point selection, dynamic grid customization, and real-time visualization of algorithmic pathways.
- A Algorithm*: Uses heuristic estimations for expedited route finding.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Explores all possible paths consistently.

Resource Allocation
- Tools and Technologies
	- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
	- Backend: JavaScript
	- APIs/Frameworks: TBD
	- Security Tools: TBD
- Required Resources
	- GitHub, IDEs for development
	- Multimedia resources for integration

Success Criteria
The project will be successful if:
- The web app accurately visualizes Dijkstra and A* algorithms.
- It meets performance, usability, and security standards.
- All deliverables (source code, documentation, presentation) are completed on time.
