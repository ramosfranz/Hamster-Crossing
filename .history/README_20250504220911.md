# 🐹🎡🌻 Hamster Crossing 🌻🎡🐹

---

## 🎡 Project Overview

**Hamster Crossing** is a web-based interactive simulation that visually demonstrates and compares two path-finding algorithms: **A\***, **Dijkstra**, **Breadth-First Search**, **Depth-First Search**, and **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**.  
Users interact with a dynamic grid where a hamster (the subject) must reach a sunflower seed (the goal), navigating through user-defined or randomly generated barriers.

Key Points: <br>
🐹 **A\*** uses heuristic estimations to find the fastest path efficiently. <br>
🐹 **Dijkstra's Algorithm** explores all possible paths uniformly to guarantee the shortest route. <br>
🐹 **Breadth-First Search** finds the shortest path by visiting nodes layer by layer. <br>
🐹 **Depth-First Search** dives deep into paths before backtracking, without guaranteeing the shortest path. <br>
🐹 **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** calculates shortest paths even when negative weights exist, though slower than Dijkstra. <br>

This system targets students, educators, and algorithm enthusiasts by making complex algorithmic logic intuitive and engaging.

## 🌻 Objectives

🎯 Visually demonstrate path-finding algorithms through an interactive grid. <br>
🎯 Enhance user understanding of heuristic vs exhaustive search strategies. <br>
🎯 Allow manual and random setup of barriers, start, and goal points. <br>
🎯 Animate pathfinding exploration using a hamster for intuitive visualization. <br>
🎯 Support education in computer science by providing an interactive teaching tool. <br>
🎯 Showcase algorithm adaptability when the environment changes dynamically. <br>
