### Project Dates
🎡 Start Date: November 4, 2024 <br>
🎡 Expected Completion Date: November 24, 2024 <br>

**Hamster Crossing** is a web-based interactive simulation that visually demonstrates and compares different path-finding algorithms: **A\***, **Dijkstra**, **Breadth-First Search**, **Depth-First Search**, and **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**.  
Users interact with a dynamic grid where a hamster (the subject) must reach a sunflower seed (the goal), navigating through user-defined or randomly generated barriers.

### Resource Allocation
**Tools and Technologies** <br>
	🌻 Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 <br>
	🌻 Backend: JavaScript <br>
	🌻 APIs/Frameworks: TBD <br>
	🌻 Security Tools: TBD <br>
 **Required Resources** <br>
	🌻 GitHub, IDEs for development <br>
	🌻 Multimedia resources for integration <br>

This system targets students, educators, and algorithm enthusiasts by making complex algorithmic logic intuitive and engaging.

## 🌻 Objectives

🎯 Visually demonstrate path-finding algorithms through an interactive grid. <br>
🎯 Enhance user understanding of heuristic vs exhaustive search strategies. <br>
🎯 Allow manual and random setup of barriers, start, and goal points. <br>
🎯 Animate pathfinding exploration using a hamster for intuitive visualization. <br>
🎯 Support education in computer science by providing an interactive teaching tool. <br>
🎯 Showcase algorithm adaptability when the environment changes dynamically. <br>

## 🌻 Installation Instructions
1. Navigate to the directory `Hamster-Crossing/src`
2. Launch the file `hamsterMenu.html`
---

## 🐹 Usage Instructions
1. Select **Choose a Hamster** and pick your desired hamster.
2. Select **Play Game**, you will be directed to a new section.
3. Start placing down sunflowers as they will act as walls the the hamster cannot go through.
4. Click run algorithm and watch how each algorithm thinks and traverses the grid
5. You additionally have the option to randomly genrate the maze on the grid by clicking **Randomly Generate Grid** on the main menu
6. Click about to learn more about each algorithm.
